# DDR A3 THEME

Modification of Curilang's DDR-A3-THEME

## OVERVIEW OF CHANGES
• Improvements when using a dance pad for menu controls instead of keyboard or control panel  
• Various profile changes (data for local vs. machine profiles), selecting profile, etc.  
• Missed hold note and let go count as misses when calculating status icons (otherwise e.g. missing a hold note could still award a full combo)  
• Looks at all scores (not just high score) for status icons (e.g. will show full combo status from lower score, even if highest score had a miss)  
• Minor changes for personal preferences (skip language screen, reduce time showing caution screen, etc.)  
• Misc. other tweaks (look at commit details - attempted to break up commits and provide details to more easily pick and choose changes)

## OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
Not included in this repo, but other improvements I've used with this theme:  
• Announcers from: https://github.com/h-lunah/DDR-A3-KIT (though I found them to be too loud - I slightly reduced the volume of all files since there doesn't seem to be a separate announcer volume control)  
• Noteskins from: https://github.com/SchneiderAFX/Schneiders-DDR-HD-Noteskins  
• SNCharacters from: https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/thread?threadid=10706&page=1  
Note: The newest version of this theme removed support for SNCharacters and DanceStages, but RandomMovies are supported, so I placed all the SNCharacters video files in the RandomMovies directory.  The .mp4 files need to be renamed to .avi, since while SM can play .mp4 files, RandomMovies skips them for some reason.

# CURRENT SUPPORTED STEPMANIA BUILDS

Only tested on StepMania [5.1.0-new*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lZNWndWcsNDZlF1pwY02g1ZrQUQMqj5M/view?usp=sharing)  
*build date: 2025-07-18 + Noteskin overlaping fix

May also work on  
• [ITGMania](https://www.itgmania.com/)  
• [OutFox](https://projectoutfox.com/)  
(though ITGMania and OutFox have different in-game quit/pause button behavior, which doesn't work well when mapped to the dance pad)
